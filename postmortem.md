Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
Made multiple layouts (not logged in, logged in, logged in as admin). Quite repetitive. Next time: DRY

What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
Learnt to write nested SQL queries (line 248) and code for multiple statements per pool.query (lines 394 - 422)

For each, please include code examples.

Code snippet up to 20 lines.

Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

Your Boss at the Gamme Development company you work for has told you that the requirements of your game has changed.

There are generally 3 ways that business requirements force you to change your code.

They are adding a new feature. How would you refactor your code to account for this new thing you must add?
They are changing direction. Your code does X and it needs to be changed to do Y, which is different but still related.
They are adding a white label feature- our clients can have their own X game, with custom players, branding, etc. How do you account for dynamically accomadating each new client?


WDI Unit 1 Post Mortem
What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
Pre-planning - helped to map out the diff functions of the app and how CRUD could have been implemented into it before actually starting to code

What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
Not so good at time-management.

How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
